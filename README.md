Overview
Welcome to the "Guess the Number" game! This simple Python project allows the player to guess a number between 1 and 10. The computer generates a random number, and the player must guess it. The game provides feedback after each guess, telling the player if the guessed number is higher, lower, or correct.

The game loops until the player guesses the correct number.
Basic error handling for invalid or non-positive inputs.
